# Snake and Pong Games

This repository contains two classic arcade games, Snake and Pong, implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The main code for both games is located in the `main.py` file within their respective folders.

## Snake Game

### Description

The Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.

### How to Play

1. Run the game by executing `main.py` in the "Snake" folder.
2. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's direction.
3. Collect the food to grow the snake and earn points.
4. Avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's body.
5. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.

## Pong Game

### Description

The Pong game is a classic table tennis simulation where two players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth.

### How to Play

1. Run the game by executing `main.py` in the "Pong" folder.
2. Player 1 uses the "W" and "S" keys to control their paddle (up and down).
3. Player 2 uses the up and down arrow keys to control their paddle.
4. Hit the ball with your paddle to score points.
5. The game ends when one player fails to hit the ball, and the opposing player scores a point.

## Dependencies

Both games utilize the Pygame library. Make sure you have Pygame installed before running the games.

You can install Pygame using pip:

```
pip install pygame
```
